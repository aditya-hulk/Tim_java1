# 7. Biggest tip to succeed as a Java programmer.
![Alt text](image-5.png)
To be persistent.  
You're finding your way to becoming a programmer.
It is a journey that can be frustrating at times.  
You may even want to give up at times, but the people who succeed as a programmer work
through that and come out the other side as programmers.  
That's just the nature of learning to program.  
Rewarding most definitely but frustrating at times.
You get frustrated because things aren't coming to you naturally.  
Still, over time, you get better and better at programming, and things will make a lot more sense.

# 7.1 The Number-1 skill you need to have become a s/w devloper.
U need to show persistence to succeed as a programmer.    
persist - दृढ रहना / लगा रहना  continuing without change in function or structure  
Pgming ki journey bahut frustated hi hai, aap kiska concept dekhonge usse apply nhi kar pate starting pe..   
ya some of the things are not work.   
But all this are natural part of programmer.  
### Slogan rat lo  
***I am not going to give up until i master this particular thing***
Something overwhelming --> is very intense and hard to deal with:   
-- overwhelming events make people worried and stressed out.  
 It's hard to overcome overwhelming things.  
-->     If you feel an overwhelming need to laugh, you're probably going to laugh.   
-->If you have an overwhelming feeling of sadness, you'll probably cry.

### ragequit
--> angrily abandon an activity or pursuit that has become frustrating, especially the playing of a video game.
### Mordor 
--> is the realm and base of the evil Sauron = ghinouna. 
### Orcs  
--> a mythical creature (as a sea monster, giant, or ogre) of horrid form or aspect.
### hiccups 
-->रुकावटें / हिचकी
#### Any skill takes time to learn, and more time to master.  Be persistence, and keep moving forward.

# 7.2 Four stages of becoming a programmer.

aapko pgm sikhna hai to uske liye kya kya padhna honga..  
--> eg- web devloper ke liye kya karna hota hia.. nil bate sannnta.  
-->aapko pata nhi hai ki syntax kya hai.. kaise coding karte hai.. usme concept kya hia..   
--> abhi sare answer aapke pass nhi hai.. 
aapko 1 course finish karna hia.. then go to next..
![Alt text](image-9.png)
ab aapko pata chal gya hia ki hume kya padhna hai  
-->eg- Web devloper ko basic mein html, css and javascript aane ko hona.. Uske upar frameworks build hia..  
So you practice to learning that stuff become frustrate by committing mistake so often..
![Alt text](image-10.png)
abhi aap sikhne lage.. apne book ya course purchase kiya..   
-->abhi code bhi chal riya hia   
--> chije samjh aa rahi hia  
--> but practice bhi suru hai conciously.
![Alt text](image-11.png)
Bahut practice kari apne so that

# 13. Configuring installation and intro to Jshell
### Open command prompt =   
   - type java -version to check version of java
### For writing java code
 - U can use notepad but here you have to compile and run java code manually
 - IntelliJ code editor
### We can execute java command from terminal
 - open cmd and type java -version in order to fetch version of java
 - type java you will get list of multiple java commands.

 #### eval
  -  computer programming function. Related to "evaluation"

### ctr + c se bahar and /exit se pura bahar
# ***Section-3:First Step***
# 14. Hello World
emulates   
- to try to do something as well as, or better than, somebody  
- किसी के बराबर होने या उससे आगे बढ़ने की चेष्‍टा करना

nuances 
  - a very small difference in meaning, feeling, sound, etc.  
 - अर्थ, मनोभाव, ध्वनि आदि में सूक्ष्‍म अंतर
 ### Print Hello World! using Jshell
 ![Alt text](image-33.png)
 System.out.println("Hello World!"); is a ***Statement*** in java.
 ### What is statement?
 It's a complete command to be executed. It can include one or more expressions. 
 ![Alt text](image-34.png)
 ### Don't forget that Java is write once run anywhere, and that little java pgm you just write can be executed on any device that runs java.
 ### Remember that in JShell, you can see the history of the lines you've previously typed, using the up and down arrows.
### Next, I'll remove the closing parentheses, to see what JShell does:
![Alt text](image-35.png)
OK, so what does this somewhat weird-looking new prompt mean?   
Well, JShell is assuming we haven't finished typing in all of the code (since we haven't closed the parentheses set),  
so it waits for us to type something in. I can now go ahead and add the closing  
parentheses here on this line, and the semi-colon (completing the statement), then press enter:
![Alt text](image-36.png)
![Alt text](image-39.png)
### Remember that the key combination 'control c', on windows, or 'control d' on a mac or a linux machine, should cancel what you are in the middle of, and get you back to the JShell prompt.
### Typing forward slash and the word 'exit', or forward slash with the shortcut text ex, will end your JShell session, if you get stuck.
### An example would be /exit or /ex.

# 15 Variables

### The highlighted keyword are primitive data type.
![Alt text](image-44.png)
![Alt text](image-45.png)
### Now a variable, as the name suggests, can be changed – in  other words, its contents are variable.
 ### So what we have to do, is tell the computer what type of information we want to store in the variable, and then give the variable a name.
 ![Alt text](image-46.png)
 ![Alt text](image-47.png)
 ### So here, we've defined our first variable – by specifying a data type of int, and giving the variable the name of myFirstNumber.
 ##  = is an assignment operator
 ## ; tells the java this line/statement is complete.
 ![Alt text](image-48.png)
 omitted 
  - to leave out or leave unmentioned
### If you're initializing a variable in the declaration statement, what you type to the right of the equals sign,is assigned as the value of the variable. This is known – the part of the statement that follows the equals sign – as an expression in Java.
![Alt text](image-49.png)
### Also the java is taking care to store this number 5 in memory location and aap usko access kar sakte ho apke declare name i.e myFirstNumber se.
in essence 
 - basically and without regard for peripheral details; fundamentally.

essence 
  - the basic or most important quality of something

### aapne abhi declaration statement mein variable ki value initialize ki hai.. aap value baad mein bhi initialize kar sakte.
### Change variable value from 5 to 10
![Alt text](image-54.png)
### Jiase aapne declare kiye myFirstNumber ye variable name hai, uske andar aap int type ka data rakh sakte ho ... abhi uski value 5 hai.. kal aap 10 se bhi change kar sakte ho.. that's variable
![Alt text](image-53.png)
![Alt text](image-55.png)
### ab tak aapne joh bhi command type kiye jshell par aap usse /list karke dekh sakte
![Alt text](image-56.png)
### Jshell aur java compiler mein diff kya hia.. 
#### App redeclare kar sakte ho variable ko jshell mein but java compiler error marta.
![Alt text](image-57.png)
### Note that we can assign a value to a variable multiple times in Java, but it’s the declaration (which includes the data type) that cannot normally be done a second time for the same variable.
