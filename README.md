# 7. Biggest tip to succeed as a Java programmer.
![Alt text](image-5.png)
To be persistent.  
You're finding your way to becoming a programmer.
It is a journey that can be frustrating at times.  
You may even want to give up at times, but the people who succeed as a programmer work
through that and come out the other side as programmers.  
That's just the nature of learning to program.  
Rewarding most definitely but frustrating at times.
You get frustrated because things aren't coming to you naturally.  
Still, over time, you get better and better at programming, and things will make a lot more sense.
